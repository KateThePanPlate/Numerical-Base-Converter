# Numerical-Base-Converter
Converts between bases! Converts integers to and from any integer base*
By default the program only works from bases -62 to 62 with the exceptions of 0 and -1 however that can be edited by editing the DIGITS variable, adding more will increase the number of bases
Bear in mind that the converter only works for *integers* and will not accept floats
As well keep in mind that using a , in the number to be converted will result in the program not functioning (unless you add , to the DIGITS variable)
